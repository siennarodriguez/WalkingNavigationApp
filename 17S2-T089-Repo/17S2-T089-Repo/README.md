# Walking Navigation App
My first Software Engineering project!
The Walking Navigation App is designed to navigate vision impaired people from one location to another. Assuming the person needs directions around Monash University, a series of pathways on campus are displayed on the Navigator page with their respective headings. Each path briefs the user on the the total distance and number of turns involved for that path. To navigate to a path, simply click on the desired path to open it. The location of the user will be asked for and a map displaying the current location and the pathway will be outlined in red. Underneath the map is a table that includes the distance, average speed, time to destination and directions for the userâ€™s convenience.

# Specifications
* Gets a list of paths from Campus Nav web service
* Gives user walking directions along their selected path


# What I learned 
* Classes
* Local storage
* Material design Lite
* Geolocation API
* Google Maps JavaScript API

# How the functionality works:
* Load path details
* Create a Path class
* Show a list of paths
* Perform location tracking
* Determine next waypoint
* Calculate disctance and direction to next waypoint
* Estiamte remaining distance and average speed
